This is the aqar blog task.

# How to setup

1. edit the .env file to add your database credentials.
2. create a new database ( the name I used was aqar_blog )
3. open the terminal and cd into the main directory of the project.
4. run `php artisan migrate` command to run the db migrations.
5. run `php artisan serve` command to run a development server.

That's it. Enjoy.
